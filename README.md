# MagicFeel (Demo)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
MagicFeel was a motion design toolset. The project was orginally developed in mid-2017. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
But it wasn't built with other developers in mind— sharing or even viewing. This demo is a rebuild of that feature (with git and documentation) to show the some of the work & thought that went into building the original code.

## Public Collaboration

This project is currently *not* accepting any contributions

## Tech Stack
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
**Javascript[ES6]** — This project is primarily comprised of JS

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
**GSAP 2** — This is a JS animation tooling that renders fasters & better than jQuery

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
**Parcel.js** — This compiles, bundles, and minifies our JS code

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
**Squarespace** — This is the platform that our animations were targeted for

## Computer Science Concepts 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
**Modular Code** - Between clients, I wanted reuseable code. Creating modules of animation types helped with development flexibility

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
**Object Oriented Programming (OOP)** - I would create lists of the objects/elements classified by how it would be animated
