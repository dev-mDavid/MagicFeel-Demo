# MagicFeel (Demo)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
MagicFeel was a motion design feature for my web development freelance business. The project was orginally developed in mid-2017. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This demo is a rebuild of the that service.

## Tech Stack
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
**Javascript[ES6]** — This project is primarily comprised of JS

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
**GSAP 2** — This is a JS animation tooling that renders fasters & better than jQuery

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
**Parcel.js** — This compiles, bundles, and minifies our JS code

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
**Squarespace** — This is the platform that our animations were targeted for

## Computer Science Concepts 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
**Modular Code** - Between clients, I wanted reuseable code. Creating modules of animation types helped with development flexibility

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
**Object Oriented Programming (OOP)** - I would create lists of the objects/elements classified by how it would be animated
